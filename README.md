# AutoPromptFill
AutoPromptFill is a unique Chrome extension designed to enhance your productivity with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). This tool automatically fills prompts that you've created using the [Prompt Toolbox](https://prompttoolbox.com) Now you can quickly fill your prompts without the hassle, freeing up your time for more creative work.

## How to use
1. Download and extract repo into a new folder
2. open chrome://extensions/
3. Make sure "developer mode" (top right toggle) is turned ON
4. click "Load unpacked" (top left) and Select folder containing AutoPromptFill files

The new "autofill" button will AUTOMATICALLY appear on <https://PromptToolbox.com> next to the existing "copy to clipboard" button when you view a prompt. 

## TODO
When a bit more testing and bug fixing is done will submit to Chrome Store so updates are rolled out and it is much easier to install
